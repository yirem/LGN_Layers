The raw data for these analysis will be available at openneuro.org

Here, each folder represents a certain part of the analysis. However, all the data are from the same three subjects.

Each folder is composed of:
	FSL codes:	.rtf files that can be used on bash to process the raw MRI data.
			It is important that the quotation marks are not corrected for these .rtf files.
	data: 		.nii.gz files that are masked for LGN + the output .mat files from the experiments (only for fMRIs).
			To be used for the MATLAB analysis
	MATLAB codes:	.m files to process data on MATLAB
